% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}{png/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no

  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

% 
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

\begin{abstract}
The biannual Games Done Quick events, hosted on Twitch.tv, raise money for the Prevent Cancer Foundation and Doctors Without Borders. These events grow larger each year and donation data is publicly available. In this paper, we scrape the available data with the Scrapy library for Python as well as analyze and visualize the dataset in R and Minitab. The GDQ events' donation totals grow linearly year to year, and the mean and median donation also grow significantly. A few games and games series', including Super Metroid and the Zelda series, repeat in raising top donation totals and significant portions of each event's overall donation totals.

\IEEEPARstart{G}{ames} Done Quick (GDQ) is a biannual speedrunning event streamed via Twitch.tv which encourages donating to Doctors Without Borders, the Prevent Cancer Foundation, or similar charties depending on the event. Over the course of multiple days, many participants in GDQ complete video games as fast as possible while viewers on Twitch.tv watch, chat via Twitch chat, and donate to charity through the GDQ website. There are two main events per year, namely Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ) in February and Summer Games Done Quick (SGDQ) in July. Both events have been gaining in popularity each year, raising considerably more money for charity each year. In this paper, we analyze the donations during AGDQ and SGDQ events from 2011 through 2017 using data from publicly available GDQ donation tracker.

\section{Previous Work}

Max Woolf, A.K.A "minimaxir", analyzed donations for AGDQ 2016 in his blog article "Video Games and Charity: Analyzing Awesome Games Done Quick 2016 Donations\cite{minimaxir}." In his analysis, he visualized the cumulative donation total for AGDQ 2016, a histogram of donation amounts, and provided bar charts for donation amounts earned by both runs and bid incentives. This paper expands on Woolf's analysis by comparing different GDQ events.

\section {Tools}

In this analysis, we scrape the data from the Games Done Quick website using the Python library Scrapy, merge the schedule and donation datasets using R, and apply data analysis and visualizations using R\cite{R} and Minitab 17\cite{Minitab}.

\section{Data Collection}

Game Done Quick donations and event schedules are available on their tracker https://gamesdonequick.com/tracker/. To collect the donation and schedule data, we can write a scraper. In this case, we use the Python\cite{python} library Scrapy\cite{scrapy}. This resulted in JSON files representing donations and schedules for each event. We scrape all Summer Games Done Quick events from 2011 though 2016 and Awesome Games Done Quick events from 2012 through 2017. The necessary scraped donation data was the donation time and donation amount, though other unused attributes including each person's donor ID and whether or not they commented was scraped as well. The necessary scraped schedule data includes the run name (called "game" in our scraper), the run's start time, and the run's end time. Additional attributes, including the run description, players involved in the run, and whether or not the run is part of a bid incentive, were also scraped.

The resulting sets of donation and schedule JSON files then need to be merged. For this we load one of the schedule JSON files into R, set it to data frame called "runs", and write a function that returns the run name during given a datetime. See listing 1 for the R code.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={R code for merging GDQ donation and schedule data}\label{lst:1}]
timeRun <- function(x) {
    duringRun = (x > runs$starttime)
    & (x < runs$endttime)
    if (sum(duringRun, na.rm = T) > 0) {
        return (runs$game[which(duringRun)])
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

When running the above function with a time x that coincides with a run, it will return the run name. Using this function, we can do a mutation on a data frame of donations from that event to add a column to the donation table including the run name. If we load a JSON donations file into an R data frame called "donations", we can run the mutation as seen in listing 2.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={R code for merging GDQ donation and schedule data}\label{lst:2}]
donations <- donations %>% mutate(
             timeRun = sapply(time, timeRun))
\end{lstlisting}

The donations data frame now includes the columns donation amount, time of donation, and the run played during the donation. This data frame can be exported into a CSV file for further analysis in other tools. The process can be repeated for all of the scraped JSON files.

\section{Analysis}

With the donations and associated runs for each GDQ event in a handful of CSV files, we can now analyze the data.

\subsection{Basic Statistics}

The mean of individual donation amounts for early SGDQ and AGDQ events, including SGDQ 2011, AGDQ 2012, SGDQ 2012, AGDQ 2013, and SGDQ2013 is \$21.5 +/- \$4, though it rose to \$40 by AGDQ 2017. The median was \$10 for the 2011 and 2012 events but rose to \$15 and \$25 depending on the individual event with the highest median being \$25 during AGDQ2015. The number of donors also rose from 1,118 in SGDQ 2011 to 30,847 in SGDQ 2016, and from 5872 in AGDQ 2012 to 43,461 in AGDQ 2017. SGDQ 2011 raised \$21,396 in total while SGDQ 2016 raised \$992,553 in total. AGDQ 2012 raised \$131,638 in total while AGDQ 2017 raised \$1,790,550 in total. It's worth noting that each AGDQ and SGDQ event raised more money than each of their previous events, except for AGDQ 2016 which raised less money than AGDQ 2015. The higher medians indicate that each donor is donating more in general. The means being around double of the median indicate that high-value donors heavily skew the mean.

\subsection{Histograms}

Viewing histograms of donation amounts for each event helps us understand the changes in overall donation behavior that result in higher means and medians, and shows us how many people are donating at different amounts. These histograms in figures 1 though 4 were generated in Minitab 17.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{SGDQ2011Histogram}
	\caption{Histogram of SGDQ 2011 Donation Amounts}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{SGDQ2016Histogram}
	\caption{Histogram of SGDQ 2016 Donation Amounts}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{AGDQ2012Histogram}
	\caption{Histogram of AGDQ 2012 Donation Amounts}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{AGDQ2017Histogram}
	\caption{Histogram of AGDQ 2017 Donation Amounts}
\end{figure}

As expected based on the basic statistics, donations tend to be higher valued in later events. Especially notable is the growth in \$50, \$75, and \$100 donations. The range of these histograms only shows donation values from \$0 to \$100, but some other high values such as \$200 also show large growth from the old to more recent events.


\subsection{Highest contributing runs}

Since there are many runs of games in Games Done Quick, it is helpful to find out which events raise the most money overall. It might also be helpful to see which, if any, of the highest earning runs occur in many of the GDQ events.

The schedules for GDQ events before 2015 on the GDQ donation tracker are incomplete, so the 2011 through 2014 events won't be used for this part of the analysis. The following bar charts were generated in R.

Every GDQ event has at least one Zelda series game run, one Super Mario series game run as well as a Super Metroid run in the top 15 highest donation earning runs.

Super Metroid has a cultural reason to be in the top 15 for every GDQ event. Historically in the speedrunning community, it's always faster to leave a small group of alien animals to die in the final level of the game, but an early speedrunner beat the game so quickly that they both saved the animals (wasting around 25 seconds) and still beat the game's world record at the time. During every GDQ event, the bid incentive for "Save/Kill The Animals" has been a hotly debated topic and results in nearly equal bids for saving versus killing the animals. This is the most talked about bid during GDQ events.

The other high-earning runs likely come down to general game and game series popularity.

\subsection{Growth}

We can also analyze growth of GDQ events overall. Since SGDQ events usually earn less than neighboring AGDQ events, SGDQ and AGDQ event totals grow at different rates. The growth also appears linear for each event, as we can see in the Linear regression plots in figures 10 and 11.

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{AGDQLinearRegression}
	\caption{Linear Regression of AGDQ events}
\end{figure}

Using the linear regression equations in the plots, we can predict the amounts that could be raised by the next events. We can expect SGDQ 2017 in July to raise around \$941,119 and AGDQ 2018 in February to raise around \$1,510,386. Whether the linear growth will actually continue for future events remains to be seen.

We can also plot the running totals of each event over time since the start of each event. What we can notice from this figure is that recent events raise money at somewhat comparable rates until the final hours of each event. At the end of each event, especially the recent AGDQ 2017, there is a spike of donations and an immediate dropoff once the events end.

\section{Discussion}

Code and various artifacts of this project -- including the scraper, dataset, R workspace, Minitab file, and generated visualizations -- are available in this project's Github repository \cite{gdqgit}.

Running the code requires installing scrapy through PyPi. The dplyr and magrittr packages need to be installed in R to merge the schedule and donation data using the method in the available code.

\section{Conclusion}

The growth of AGDQ and SGDQ events appears linear, so future donation totals could be predicted. The distribution of donation amounts seems to grow more even over the year, yielding a higher median and average donation. Multiple games and game series' repeatedly appear in the top fifteen games in relation to how much money they raise.


\section{Future work}

There is still some work to be done to provide a more complete analysis. We did not compare donation incentives (bids) between GDQ events. Repeat donor behavior was also not analyzed, though it could be analyzed since we have donor ID's for repeat, non-anonymous donors. The SGDQ 2017 and AGDQ 2018 donation total predictions should also be checked when those events pass.
